These are the proects for my ECGR 4090 AI and Robotics class for the Fall 2023 semester
In this class we built a number of projects that utilized varying types of neural networks to robotics oriented projects

- Project 1: Neural network based maze solver

- Project 2: Neural network based inverse kenomatics

- Project 3: Neural network based cartpole simulator

- Project 4: Multi network DNN compairison
